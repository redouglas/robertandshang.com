Despite being slightly put off by his pretentious-looking profile picture, the attraction was undeniable. At the urging of her cousin, she connected with Robert over the app.</p><p>Several weeks would pass before they actually met each other in person. On their first date they discovered how easy it was to talk with each other and quickly became close as they discovered their many shared interests. They spent their second date building Legos. According to Robert, that 'pretty much sealed the deal'.</p><p>After that, they continued to embrace all that life has to offer and pushed each other to experience new things. Somehow Robert convinced Shang to bungee jump off a bridge, and Shang (finally) brought Robert outside of the country on a trip to Japan. Since then, they’ve been to music festivals, seen the Northern Lights, got certified for scuba diving, scaled the Great Wall of China, and fell in love with traveling together.</p><p>It was during their second trip to Japan in the spring of 2018 that Robert popped the question in Kyoto under a beautiful sakura tree, while being&nbsp;<span class="strike">cheered on</span>&nbsp;stared at by dozens of well-wishing locals and tourists.</p></div></div></section><section class="location"><h2 class="section-header">Venue</h2><div class="grid"><div class="col-2"><h3>Malibou Lake Mountain Club</h3><a href="https://goo.gl/maps/3HgPzXymj4K2" target="_blank" class="address"><span>29033 Lake Vista Dr.</span><br><span>Agoura Hills, CA 91301</span></a><div class="description"><p>The Lodge at Malibou Lake is an historic venue in Agoura Hills, Southern California.

For families or groups larger than two, we recommend trying &nbsp;<a href="https://www.airbnb.com/s/Malibou-Lake-Mountain-Club--Lake-Vista-Drive--Agoura-Hills--CA--USA/homes?refinement_paths%5B%5D=%2Fhomes&amp;place_id=ChIJ9zlGrHch6IARS39hLhUEack&amp;query=Malibou%20Lake%20Mountain%20Club%2C%20Lake%20Vista%20Drive%2C%20Agoura%20Hills%2C%20CA%2C%20USA&amp;room_types%5B%5D=Entire%20home%2Fapt&amp;allow_override%5B%5D=&amp;s_tag=At0Cm7Dy">AirBNB</a>.</p><div class="seperator"></div><h3>Transportation</h3><p>We recommend using &nbsp;<a href="https://www.lyft.com/ici/DOUGLAS20639">Lyft</a>&nbsp;for transportation around town and from the airport to the hotel. If you're going to be in town for a while, you might also consider renting a car at the airport.</p><br><h3>Hotel to Venue</h3><p>Transportation will be provided via shuttle from the hotel to the wedding venue. Stay tuned for more information.</p></div></div></section><section class="outoftown"><h2 class="section-header">For Out of Town Guests</h2><div class="grid"><div class="col-3"><h3>Airports</h3><h4>Los Angeles Airport (LAX)</h4><p>This will probably be the most convenient airport for most to travel through. There are likely more flights coming in and out of LAX at cheaper prices than other airports in the area. Since it will be a holiday weekend, the airport will be very busy. For outbound flights, plan to get there at least 1.5 hours before domestic flights, and at least 3 hours before international flights.</p><h4>Burbank Airport (BUR)</h4><p>Burbank Airport is much smaller than LAX and serves mostly domestic routes, so flights may be less frequent and more expensive. However, it is closer to the wedding venue and faster to get in/out of.</p></div><div class="col-3"><h3>Where to Stay</h3><p>If you are staying for a long time, you may not want to stay at the wedding hotel for your entire trip. We recommend looking up hotels and also AirBNBs in other areas to maximize your trip. Aside from Malibu area (near the wedding venue), we recommend looking at the Santa Monica, Venice, South Bay, and Downtown areas as well.</p><div class="seperator"></div><h3>Getting Around</h3><p></p>Los Angeles is a car oriented city. We recommend using &nbsp;<a href="https://www.lyft.com/ici/DOUGLAS20639">Lyft</a>&nbsp;or Uber for on-demand travel around town. If you will be visiting for a while, renting a car from the airport may be the best and most flexible option. Los Angeles does have public transit, but due to the sheer scale of LA, can sometimes be unhelpful or difficult to navigate if you are going longer distances.</div><div class="col-3"><h3>Things to do in L.A.</h3><p>We are more than happy to make any custom suggestions (just email us). There are lots to do but keep in mind that most of it is spread out. We also recommend avoiding most of the common suggestions like seeing the Hollywood sign or the Walk of Fame since they tend to be underwhelming, hard to get to, and sometimes in mildly unsafe areas.</p><p>Here are some places to get some ideas of what to do:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Tourism-g32655-Los_Angeles_California-Vacations.html" target="_blank">Tripadvisor</a></li><li><a href="https://www.discoverlosangeles.com/" target="_blank">Discover LA</a></li><li><a href="http://www.latourist.com/" target="_blank">LA Tourist</a></li><li><a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/d/ca--los-angeles/events/" target="_blank">Events in LA</a></li></ul></div></div></section><section class="rsvp"><h2 class="section-header">RSVP</h2><a name="rsvp"></a><form id="rsvpForm"><p class="reminder">Reminder: Because of limitations from the venue and to create a more relaxed atmosphere for our guests, only children from close family will be present.
